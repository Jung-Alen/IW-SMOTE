# Introduction

*The project of  Instance Weighted SMOTE by Indirectly Exploring the Data Distribution*

## 1. The main algorithm

IW-SMOTE

## 2. Main comparison algorithm

- Borderline SMOTE (B-SMOTE), 
- ADASYN, 
- Safe-level SMOTE (SL-SMOTE), 
- Majority Weighting Minority Oversampling TEchnology (MWMOTE) 
- Surrounding neighborhood-based SMOTE (SN-SMOTE), 
- SMOTE-TL, 
- SMOTE-ENN, 
- SMOTE-IPF. 
- These algorithms are mainly from SMOTE-Variants package.

## 3. Some extended algorithms

- WKSMOTE
- SMOTE-CSELM
